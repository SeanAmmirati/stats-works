However, the smoothing parameters are relatively the same in character, with alpha=0.8973698 beta=0.003048736 and gamma: 1. This indicates that the level and seasonality are smoothing based on observations in the distant past (with gamma = 1 meaning it is considering only the previous observations), while a small beta indicates that it is using the trend of only the nearest values. I have plotted one of the models below, but the other is very similar in nature. However, as we will see later, the prediction error is quite high – (and the prediction error for the multiplicative model is, predictably, much higher).\n"
